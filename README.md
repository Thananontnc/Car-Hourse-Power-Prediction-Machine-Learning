# Car horsepower prediction by using machine learning (R)
The primary objective of our research is to employ our knowledge of R and analyze the
relationship between horsepower and car prices while moderating the body types of cars. We will
analyze our dataset sourced from Kaggle.com in R studio, which provides a rich base for
analysis. We will employ analytical strategies that fit best to our project. As mentioned above,
using a moderate regression from ANCOV A, we still specifically assess the relationship between
a car’s horsepower and its market price, taking into account how different body types might
influence this relationship. For example, the relationship between the horsepower and the car’s
price in a sedan body type, might not be as significant as if it has a hatchback body type. Using R
studio’s visualization capabilities to create scatter plots and heat graphs are also crucial, to
graphically depict a clear representation of our findings. By conducting this analysis, we aim to
solve how various features and designs contribute to the overall value of a vehicle, which
provides a deeper understanding of the automotive market dynamics for both buyers and sellers.

Research Question:
"How does horsepower influence the price of a car, and how does this relationship vary among
different car body types?"
